# Hey, I'm Matthew

**Founder & AI Engineer** at [Me, Myself Plus AI](https://memyselfplusai.com) | Building the bridge between AI and everything else

I specialize in **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** that extend Claude's capabilities into the real world.

## MCP Servers

I build MCP servers that let Claude interact with smart devices, business systems, and games:

| Server | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [mcp-dyson-appliances](https://github.com/MatthewSnow2/mcp-dyson-appliances) | Control Dyson air purifiers and fans | Production |
| [mcp-philips-hue](https://github.com/MatthewSnow2/mcp-philips-hue) | Smart lighting control | Production |
| [mcp-mirage](https://github.com/MatthewSnow2/mcp-mirage) | Extract brand identity from websites | Production |
| [mcp-dsp](https://github.com/MatthewSnow2/mcp-dsp) | Dyson Sphere Program game optimization | Active |
| [mcp-pointcare-ratchet](https://github.com/MatthewSnow2/mcp-pointcare-ratchet) | Healthcare EMR integration | Development |

### The Factory

**[GRIMLOCK](https://github.com/MatthewSnow2/grimlock)** - Autonomous MCP Server Factory

GRIMLOCK takes a PRD and builds production-ready MCP servers autonomously. It's how I rapidly prototype and deploy new integrations.
